            <p>
                I am 27 years old. I was born September 11 1991 in Chihuahua, Mexico.
                I moved to Colorado when I was 10 years old and have been here since.
                I currently work at Charter Communications as a Network Engineer.
                I like to think of myself as a gamer and I used to play a minimum of 6 hours a day.
                Besides playing video games I also enjoy board games. I currently have a decent collection,
                but would want to expand to have more.
            </p>

            <p>
                The most recent video games I have been playing lately are as follows: Fortnite, Smite, Mario Kart,
                Octopath Traveler, Super Mario Odyssey.
                Besides video games I also enjoy watching Football and Baseball. I am not the biggest fan, but I do
                enjoy
                watching the games.
                I have two cats that are around 1 year old. One is a Persian and another is a Ragdoll. Once school is
                over
                I am hoping to finish
                studying for my CCNA and getting certified. My goal will be to learn python after this and hopefully
                have
                my CCIE certification and become a Principal Engineer.
